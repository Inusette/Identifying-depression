 wake up dazed, confused realizing the world around you was yesterday but a dream? or was it a sign of things to come?  Watch Mr. Coffee sereve you your life in a cup drip       drip            drip...  my face staes back at me from the dark brown puddle     not at me, through me pondereing over the origin of my place i soon realize,        i have no memory of the past six months was it even there? you were there.
