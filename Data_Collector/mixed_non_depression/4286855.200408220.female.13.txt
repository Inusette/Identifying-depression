 i woke up early just 2 wait 4 my aunt 2 take me go shopping, but she turned me down! she was spose 2 pick me up but she have a headache so she couldnt come! :(  so i went back 2 sleep for like 4 hours. but just as i thought itz gonna b a boring day @ home, my other aunt call and invite me2 this 1 seafood restaurant. i think the foods were very delicious!!! :] i got a new watch 2 (it was from my cuzin). ive always wanted that watch but my mom wouldnt get me 1. it was dark blue, i think itd b better if itz was either pink or green. but o well. my dad say that he will take me 2 shopping again since my aunt cant.
