 heard about blog for some while... then June told me that she had just created one then i check out whether anyone taken up kit.blogspot.com... the result is page not found...  then i become so excited, thinking to have a kit.blogspot.com who knows when i signing up for an account... "kit" is an invalid id!!!! really kind of shit feeling.....  finally, created this just-kit.blogspot.com.... -.-
