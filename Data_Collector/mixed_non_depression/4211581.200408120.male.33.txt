 Ah, what a tangled web we weave.  To say im involved in some sort of bizarre love triangle would be overdoing it.  But, in a sense, maybe thats what it is.  In order to sort this out, I should start from the beginning.  I was working in a rehab for brain injured adults when I met her.  She was a petite spunky girl recently arrived in the area from california.  Some how or another, she showed interest in me and begain inviting me places outside of work.  I didn't really care, I was a student supporting myself and dealing with roomate problems, housing problems, getting to class on time, getting to work on time...the whole in and out of survival.  But, while im not all that great at subtle hints, she was aggressive enough for me to pick up on the fact that she liked me.  And so, after a long night of drinking and a bit of passing out and *unkowningly* spooning her, our relationship began.  It was cool, did all the great things you during a new relationship: trips to the beach, visiting the family, staying up late talking, holding hands, doggie style sex...(heh).  At some point, irresponsible as we were there was an abortion.  I dont want to go into here how bad that affected me; for her, I can only imagine it was much worse experience; but, it was her request and I supported it.  I do know having to walk through a thong of anti-abortion assholes didnt make it easy at all.  Not to mention I wanted to choke the living hell out of a few of em.  Time passed and the relationship seemed good.  Then, one day, she told me she was moving back to california and wanted me to come after I graduated in a semester.  I wasnt too sure about this; but, I agreed.  She left.  Afterwards, I continued to go to school and doubt settled in.  Perhaps I should break up with her?  Next installment....I move to california, relationship ends, we become friends...and then the web grows more complicated....
