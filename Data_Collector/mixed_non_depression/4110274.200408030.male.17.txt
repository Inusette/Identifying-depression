 I cant figure out why some people only give out their opinions only to destroy someone else. What is wrong with people today? I'm sick and tired of hearing views and beliefs on politics, religion, and other stuff. I'm sick of seeing the way people behave when it comes to opposing views. Why can't we just...I don't know...Sit and enjoy the fresh air on a spring day? Sounds corny I know, but isn't that better than bashing a man for what he thinks is right or wrong. What did Jesus do? He ate with people that were wrong and people who reveled in their own beliefs.  He loved them, he didn't care! I'm so sick of us so called Christians seeking out only people who disagree with us only to prove that we are right! What worth is that? Will the glory of the coming Lord be enough for them and us? I guess not because all we care about is making sure that we are right and that they are wrong. Why can't we enjoy life, loving people, enjoying that we are different and loving them to Christ, not proving it to them. Life is so short. How can we make it count if we don't live by example and live with him? When I go out in the world I will try hard not to condemn people but love them, and in the meantime...Sit and enjoy the day, instead of sinking in my own so-called "righteousness". God did not create man to argue...But to love, and prosper with him. And...By the way...If you are going to talk with people who don't agree with you, remember this, "the greatest single cause of atheism in the world today...Is Christians...Who acknowledge him with their lips and walk out the door and lead on with their lifestyle. That is what I'm believing the world simply finds unbelievable."
