 First off, let me say that English is not my native tongue but I want this to be understood for as much people as possible. So, why "Old words for a new blog"? Well, the "new blog" part is easy: this is the first time that I do something like this. And the "old words"? That's the reason I'm putting these words here.  Right now I'm in the office. My hands, my fingers, my knees are shaking; I'm lucky of being sit down. I also have a little headache and my stomach hurts bad. Do I have the flu? Nope, but it's because of something as old as the flu: I'm in love.   I admit it, I'm in love with one of my office mates; in fact, she’s my only mate because there's only the two of us here at the offcice. We're completly alone.   I don't wanna tell all the story now from the beginning, I'll do it on another time. Today, I just need to say that she's not in love with me. She hasn't told it that way, but I know it and the knowing of it it's what's killing me deep inside, making me feel really really bad. I don't know words in English to express the pain I'm going thru but I'm sure many of you know what I'm talking about. So you can imagine my situation. She's only a few steps away from me but that distance is an abyss I cannot jump. So close and so far. I wanna reach out and touch her, feel her skin (the smoothest skin ever) but I can't. And I'm dying. That's pretty close to what I'm feeling now; I feel like I'm dying.   Why she didn't tell me that she didn’t feel anything about me?  Why did she let me believe that I had any opportunity with her?
