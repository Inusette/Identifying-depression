 Well... TIme Flies...ITS been 3 weeks since i met HER and i miss her badly...i was waitiing and hoping tt she would call me... on the first and second week... my phone was really quiet...i was really sad...but wad can i do? she had no hp and grounded.. TTs no way i could contact her...i was worried abt her but theres no way tt i could find out how was her...then...on a thursday of the third week... she called me... I felt really happy when her name appears on my phone... i picked up the phone anxiously.. Its really her... the first thing i asked was.. DO i still stand a chance? Is it still possible for us to be together? But the answer she gave me was... 'I am not sure of my feelings in the furture'...how i felt??? its beyong description...I told her i would be willing to wait for her... no matter how long... 2 years?3 years?4 years?... i don mind waiting..I was so afraid tt she would leave me... she keeps appearing on my mind all the time...i can't control myself... then i was so sad tt i went drinking... tt day was a memory for me... its the first time i got drunk and almost had an accident...no one was there for me... i felt hopeless and luckyily... i had a friend who knew it and she keeps giving me advices and show care for me...she helps me a lot and i really thank her...  things began to get better and on the last week of the holiday... on the thursday,she called me...AGAin i was very very happy... i picked up the phone and heard her sweet voice... i was really feeling great...i asked her the question again and she told me... she wants to concentrate on her studies first and won't go into relationship until secondary life was over...But she said tt she believes tt 2 years later... we would be together... tts wad i was waiting to hear...my heart was like melting and was really happy... she said 2 years was not a long period of time and 2 years later... we can still be together... tt was great... really great...
