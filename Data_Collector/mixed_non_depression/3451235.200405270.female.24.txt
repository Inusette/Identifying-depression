 Well it started of ok, I did some exercising.  Then I went to the drug store to price the perscription I have been carrying around with me, and had never gotten it filled.  I found out to have it filled it would be 130$.  My god what do they think I am made of, Money? Well anyway, I won't be getting that anytime soon.  Then when I came home Pat made a really good stir fry for supper.  But then Karmen was really cranky tonight and my cat got hit by a car.  The cat's ok though so that was good. I have had such a day of ups and downs. But I am still able to say I had an ok day.  I still don't know how to post pictures on here.  But when I can I will put a picture of my beautiful baby doll.  She is positively gorgeous.  I have a job interview next week and I am really nervous. I don't know how well it will go with no voice, and I get nervous in interviews.  When I get nervous I ramble.  So I have started preparing I have over 200 questions I am going to plan the answers too, I am going to plan the questions I am going to ask them at the end and I am researching the company.  That is all I can do besides remembering to breathe.  I just feel I have to make an extra big impression perferably on the good side, since I don't have much of a voice.  So any advice you can give me for my interview would be great:) I hate interviews.  I can write wicked resumes and a good coverletter, but I suck at the talking to people. They intimidate me, and I can not seem to picture people in their underware no matter how hard I try. I never know what to wear to interviews either.  I always feel like I am under dressed for them.  I don't own a "business suite", what I have are dressy clothes but to me they don't scream interview clothes.  Anyway I think I have rambled enough for today.
