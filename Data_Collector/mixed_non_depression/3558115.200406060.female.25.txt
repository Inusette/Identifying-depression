 Yes my first entry! I really like to do this a long time ago when I found out to one of my friends this blogspot thing.... Its cool!! No need to write... If you guys don't know yet, one of my past time is writing to my diary, I have 3 notebooks filled with stuff regarding my life and it is nice to share what’s going on with my life to my friends. I hope you can visit this page everytime. Just to let you know who I really am, and what kind of person I am (its the same thing right!) haha... So everyday I will write my high time and low time... Right now my HIGH TIME: Singing again! It’s been a long time, I love to sing and I’m going to look for a way to join the choir again. That is my passion, but do not ask me to sing in public because it's not my thing to memorize lyrics of the song, but if you will request beforehand I can sing it for you... I also sing in weddings and funerals (joke!), so if you guys need a wedding singer just give me a ring! DOWN TIME: I wasn't able to sleep well I do not know why,,, maybe because there is a lot of things going on with my mind, my work, friends and family... work because I don't know yet if I will resign or not.... it's a question and you know how hard it is to look for a high paying job so I'm still thinking it over and over and over again!!! I just hope I will find an answer this week... Friends yes I love all my friends but I miss some of them specially my PREX family, we don't have time to bond anymore because of my schedule, I really miss them and I will try to make it up to you guys! My family, yes because there is a lot of things I want to do with our house I want to buy things, but of course I need money to buy it,,,, maybe one by one I can buy things for them... specially T.V. I want to buy my mom a TV for her room so that she will be able to watch even if she is in her room.... Anyway I’m sleepy now so till next time I hope I will have time tom. To write…
