 In the year 2002, was my greatest regret ever. The only peson invoved and to be blamed is me. It was my fault that I did not I did not do well in my P.S.L.E. I was studying in Coral Primary school. There is where my problems started.      Firstly, I mixed around in the wrong group. I was new in Coral Primary as I had just transfered from Loyang Primary in the second month of 2000. In the beginning I thought it would be "ok", and the things I did were fun and I enjoyed it very much. I skipped the remedials I had every day to meet my friends in the car park. There I would spend hours to play with fire but I did not smoke. I did not pick up any bad habbits as I already knew they were to harm me. And when I went home I would tell my mum that i went for my remedials. I thought I would concentrate in my work as well as well as go out with my friends. But this did not happen. Instead I started avoiding studies. Soon, I started getting involved in more trouble and later on I started thinking that my friends were more important than my studies. When the time came, that was two years later in the year 2002, I wasen't ready. It was my P.S.L.E. It was now that I realised that my mistakes.        During my exams I went blank in my weakest subject, maths. The rest of the subjects were average. I started to panic as I knew I was going to get bad marks. In the end I did. I did very badly and got into a school I did not wnted, Siglap Secondary. At first I thought that I would do anything to get out, but as time passed, I became to know the school beter and realised it was a good place to learn in. But every where there will be "this" and "thats". There is no scholl that is perfect. Well, I was confused in what to do, I was lost but I knew that I had to adapt to it and strive to do my best. I was angry and dissapointed at myself on my mistake but I knew I had to let the past be the past. But not forget the past but learn from the mistakes. I learnt my mistakes and I know that I should not do it again. Now I have stuck this in my head that I should not mix around in the wrong company as the consequences would be unbearable and that I should pay attension in my studies. Now that I know the "good" and the "bad" and now I believe I can achieve my goal.
