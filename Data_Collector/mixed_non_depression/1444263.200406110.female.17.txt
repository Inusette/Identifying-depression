 a friday all alone! this weekend means i have the house to myself. may i just share, however, that this weekend is in no way mine. the act's own my fucking ass saturday morning and my job has 'property of misty's' stmaped on it friday and saturday night. after work saturday, people are coming over to drink, cause that's the cool thing to do in high school, don't you know. sigh.  *pinches bridge of nose in exasperation* i have such a hard life. ;-)
