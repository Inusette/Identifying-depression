 I heard about a couple of jobs at work I applied for the other day. I didn't receive an interview. I'm pretty dissappointed about it, I thought my application was quite good... I was never expecting to get either of the jobs, there are people at work who definitely deserve them more than I but it is still a sensation not dissimiliar to a kick in the teeth. All my friends rallied around to make me feel better but of course when you feel like that there is very little someone can do to help. It's a matter of stewing for a few days and then getting over it, I am becoming a master this year it seems. I offered my application to my friends at work for there opinion, they all said it was pretty good, but I only got a truly honest opinion from one, my good friend anthony, he told me that while it was good, I used passive language which they warn you against, I really appreciate his honesty, you have to respect it. I think he might be one of those friends you meet rarely that you should try and hold on to for the rest of your life.. you can't waste a good friend. I actually feel the bunch of guys I've met in the last couple of years while working where I am, are the best I have ever made, they are not like some of the friends I had in high school who seem to use when appropriate and forget you at other times and I honestly don't think they ever thought about it, or the friends they are unwilling or just unable to share any emotions deeper than a bottle of beer with you.. at some point you must grow up.  I was told by Anthony the other day when he read this for the first time that adnd is an old acronym for Dungeons and Dragons dating back to 2nd Edition and that die-hards upon reading my first post would pick me up on it... and I have to say if that is so, then you really must start doing something more than dnd with your life, okay! I love the game, but really!
