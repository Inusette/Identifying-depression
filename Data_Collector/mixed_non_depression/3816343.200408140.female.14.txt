 i dont know if its me but it seems like whenever i don't see alex i really dont care. i start to think that there's no reason to actualy like him. i start to think that there's others like adrian or conor or someone else. but when i do see him its completely different i feel like there's noone else. but of course im just being stupid and tired.
