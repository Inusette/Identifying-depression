 I saw Leif yesterday.  For those of you who don't know he used to be my old roommate and a good friend of mine until he tried to rip me off anyway he could with rent and bills.  He also lied to me every opportunity he got, and then he had the audacity to tell Ryan that I lie all the time about everything.  I really could care less if I ever see him again.        Anyway, I was walking through the mall with Ryan and her mom yesterday and he and his daughter were looking at purses.  I saw him and I tried to get away from him without him noticing me.  It didn't work.  "Yeah, that's right, Adam.  You just keep on walking," he said.  "Okay," I responded and I kept on walking.  He responded with, "Shmuck!"  And then he saw Ryan and said, "Hey, baby.  How are you?"  I guess he still likes her.  I have no idea.  I really hope that's the last time I see him but I doubt it is.  A few weeks ago Ryan and I were driving back to her house and when we got to her street he was driving past us.  We turned around to see if that was him, and he turned around and drove past us again.  We turned down another street to get back to her house.  He passed us again.  Each time he covered his face, and Jennifer (another former roommate of ours who is now dating Leif) covered her face so I guess we wouldn't recognize her.  We never saw him again that day, but is he stalking me now?  Was he just bored so he got his two kids and girlfriend in the car and set out to find me?  Will I ever be rid of this guy?    Last night, I got home and Belinda (my roommate for another month) was in the kitchen.  She was leaving to go stay at a friend's house for the night, but before she left she told me that my room smelled bad.  She blamed it on my shoes or trash in my trash can.  She told me I needed to get some candles or an air freshener.  This caused a fight.  It was our first fight since moving into the place last August.  The only thing that I smell in my room is the air freshener that she put into my room a month ago that smells horrible.  My shoes are brand new and therefore do not stink.  The only trash I have in my room is paper.  My room is the only room in the house that actually smells good.  The rest of the house smells like her sausage and Slim Jims.  Anyway, I cleaned my room last night and hopefully she'll be happy now.  I only have three more weeks left in this place and after that I won't have to deal with this anymore.
