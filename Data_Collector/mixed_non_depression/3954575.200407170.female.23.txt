 So here I sit at work. Only three more hours left, I guess that's not so bad. It's over time so that makes it even better.    This online Blog idea was very clever. The user interface is very easy to use. I like it.    So when is it too soon to say I love you to someone? Or is there even a time limit on feelings and emotions. I don't think there is. I use to. I use to never believe in love at first sight. But just because you don't believe in something, doesn't mean it's not there. It's amazing how I use to think when someone would say, "Oh you'll know when you've found the person you want to spend the rest of your life with." I'd think to myself, how can that possibly be? How can you possibly know that just after meeting someone. Use to think it was all just movie talk, hollywood glamour to sell movies and merchandise. But I believe it now. I think deep down in my heart I had always wanted to believe it, but never wanted to get my hopes up for fear of being let down.    An Ex of mine use to get so aggrivated with me during our break up, cause he kept asking me if I see him in my future. I kept telling him I don't know. Because well, I don't. He kept asking if I had hopes for us to be together again, and I said, No. I don't have hopes for anything. Never have. It's better to have never hoped for anything, then to have been let down by those false hopes. But is it better to have loved and lost, then to have never loved? Going through the break up, I began thinking it's better to have never loved. But in recent events, I couldn't change my mind quick enough. I would rather have loved, and lost. The joy of being with that one person, and sharing moments and experiences that would never be the same, is priceless.    Well there is quite alot there to read. hehe I guess I should probably get some work done.
