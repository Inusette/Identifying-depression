 It is a boring Sunday in the eyes of Renee Miller...  I just got home from church, actually.  I'm really quite tired, but I don't like to sleep during the day, cuz then i can never sleep at night!! anyways.. i got home from minneaoplis late friday night.  it was an exciting time.  i went to a science museum, which was kinda gay...but then we hit VALLEYFAIR!.. that was pretty sweet ass, except for the fact that it was RAINING outside.. kind of a suck deal. the most exciting time was when cc and me were standing in line behind sum fuckin stuck up bitch-kids... i said "i had children, we shuld kill them.. then chop em up and eat em!"   and we then decided to make up foods like:  spaghetti and children balls, children noodle soup, Cambell's® Cream of Children soup, McChildren Sandwhich (hold the mayo), etc. :D it was halario!  Whitley and Spencer like the same guy, Russty.  So much fucking DRAMA if u ask me!  I don't want to get in the middle of it.  ONLY YOU CAN PREVENT FOREST FIRES!  Cc and I like the same guy, too.. but there's no drama goin on. if it gets to the point where we're fighting and shit like whitley and spencer tho.. i will definitally just let him go... its not worth a friendship.  But Jake Davis is the SWEETEST fucking guy in the world! .. i just met him, but he's awesome!   well. there'll be another post on another day.. Seeya
