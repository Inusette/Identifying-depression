 once i was sitting in the school hall having the first pe lesson,then i was looking around.when the teachers were preparing the stuff for the lesson,i spotted a girl at the oppsite side of my class.I watched her and cared nothing else,by then i realise she was my girl...once i met her at a bus stop,she was with her stead,but i didn't know that that was her stead.Thus i sat at a seat behind them,and heard what are they talking about.then as time flies,each time i looked at her,the more i liked her even more.Then,at mid august,i finally got the courage n asked her for stead,i was that surprised that she accpted me.then it lasted for a week,plus a day.we broke up, she didnt want to hurt me,cuz she had her ex in mind.somewhere at the last day of school,i asked her for stead again then we patched up for 3 days and broke up again.because of the sparse communication..when school reopened,we tried to act like nothing happened.but we still can't forget that we had the past together,we were like steads,we act like one,and we got even closer to each other.On the 27th july,we patched up.then,kelly exposed our relationship,and she was her best friend,also my friend,jac scolded her for doing this,i don't know what happend,and i actually tried to defend kelly.that dy, i sent her home,we were taking bus 105,we sat in the same sit and held hands,we treasured the time we had,and that was only the time we had together alone.but on the 4 of august, we broke up,she told me that she was a bad stead and broke up with me...then finally on the 7th of august she expained why...she again said that she was a bad stead,and her parents n brother knew about our relationship..she wanted to protect me,and she broke up with me..and she does not bare to break up ,she was crying when she told me all this,and there is nothing i could do to help.i can only see her tears rolling down her cheeks.then she took her bag and ran out of the school,i felt helpless,and started wiping..i hated the world to be so unfair to us..all we wanted i a stable relationship and nothing else..but in the end..we still have to go seperate ways...and each time i thought of she saying...i don't want to break up but i have no choice...tears will start rolling down my eyes..i did not give up once,i will wait for the right time..i will always keep her in my mind forever...
