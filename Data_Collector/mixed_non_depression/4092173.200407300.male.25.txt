 I was having a relatively average Friday at work when I decided to step outside for a fresh dose of nicotine and a butt scratch. As I was revelling in the sensation of my fading itch I noticed a flock of geese flying overhead. Inevitably the lead goose (I like to refer to the leader as "the big cheese") was cut down by a nudist pole vaulting midget (sorry, "small person" [I really like the brackets today]). As the two came crashing to the ground in a whirling pile of blood, puss  ; soft white bird feces I had a rather embarrasing moment of my own. A horrid scent tickled my senses. It was the kind of scent one doesn't pick up from a big cheese and a small person colliding 40 feet in the air. No, this scent was a little closer to home. Only after I felt the squishiness between my lower cheeks did I realize what had taken place. Some form of monsterous human being must have stolen my pants right off my body while I was distracted by the mid air catastrophy. This foul being then made doo-doo in my brand new Tazmanian Devil boxers before carefully placing them back on my body. A change of shorts and a roll of toilet paper later I began my hunt for the elusive undergarment defiling creature. Armed with only a plastic fork and a half burnt cigarette I patrolled the nearby streets for nearly half an hour when it hit me. Perhaps some of the other lower to middle class working folk in the area had been violated by the underpants bandit. I went to my truck and grabbed my CSI kit I ordered off the net. It arrived last night, just in time for me to uncover the mystery of the soiled ginch. Unfortunately I was unable to find any evidence outside of my own underpants. There didn't seem to be any eye witnesses either. Maybe they had been paid off or were just too afraid to talk. The bandit must have got to them.      This journal entry was not influenced in any way by any sort of illicit substance. I don't need drugs to be crazy.
