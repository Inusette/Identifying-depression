 Alright... I just browsed through a ton of blogs. I'm procrastinating working on my thesis... but it's so damn boring! Anyway, people put the stupidest stuff on their blogs! If you want random people to read about your life, don't post 2-word inside jokes... Blogs should be about your life... Or at least something worthwhile. Saying a bunch of random quick words that only your friends understand should be saved for your damn IM away messages. Your mindless blogs are getting in the way of people seeing mine! And mine aren't worthless. Mine are cool. They're not about "I went to the store and bought some flip-flops" but about crazy weird stories that happen to me at the mental hospital or about how I visited Bob Jones University 6 times in high school or about how I had to wear skirts below the middle of my knees to school before they came into style or about how I got kicked out of my Christian high school for having cigarettes in my car (I wasn't even smoking them!) or about how after this happened, I tried to commit suicide (that was long ago, I'm doing fine now, but thanks for asking) and while I was in the hospital being injected with crazy stuff that would make me crap and vomit until I could hardly breathe or swallow my God-fearing, compassionate high school principal was telling my parents how I was expelled. Well, at any rate... I won't bore you with worthless inside jokes. Hell, if you bother to read my blog, you'll be the better for it... you know why? Cuz I've got alot of really weird stories.
