 There are things running through my head today.  What should I do about my future.  I have a decent job, an apartment, a relationship, but  what do I want to do with my life?   There are many things I've wanted to do.  When I was in high school I wanted to be a broadcaster.  When I was in college, while things became less clear, I knew that I wanted to study English and Tudor history and combine them somehow or another.  Now that I'm out of school, all I want is to go back - to do something different; to be something more than what I am.    So, here are some things I've thought about doing.  I haven't really thought them through all the way, but that's what this sort of forum is for, right?    I've always wanted to write books.  Either researching stuff from the Elizabethan or early Tudor time period, or historical based romances or even just plain old fiction.  The problem is - what would I write about?  There are already tons of books about Elizabeth I, her sister Mary, her cousin Mary Stuart...it's a bit frustrating.  But, I suppose there's always room for a well researched, well written book out there.    I've thought about studying to become a teacher.  But, what would I teach?  English or History?  On what level would I teach?  I'm not the most patient person in the world...I'd hate teaching in an elementary school or even a middle school.  So, I guess that leaves high school and college levels.  I'd enjoy having the summers off, but probably not much else.  I'd love to be able to travel for 3 months out of every year.  Or even travel for 1 month and work the other 2 doing something else.  It's a possibility I guess I should look into.    The law has also fascinated me from a young age.  I'd love to be a lawyer.  I should look into law schools, at least to find out the requirements.    All in all, I think what I'm doing now is good for me - it's making me question what I   should  be doing and what I  could  be doing.  That's never a bad thing, is it?
