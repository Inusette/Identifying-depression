 Kevin got an email from the sportswear place asking his salary range.  Although unscrupulous, I intercepted this email via webmail and replied with a 25k-30k requirement, citing that the last job held paid 28k with benefits.  After sending this email, I let it remain in the inbox to be downloaded to his outlook.  As predicted, he saw the email and wanted to respond to it with a 25-30k requirement.  I am good.  So while he was indisposed in the shitter, I made a dummy email that said the same thing and sent it to a dummy email addy.  It was bounced back undeliverable, but I deleted it from the inbox and deleted mail box so he'll never know the difference.  When he came back in from the bathroom, he read the sent copy and was satisfied with the reply.  Not that he should actually send his own stuff.  I made the resume.  I wrote the cover letter.  I found the job.  I applied him for it.  Then he has the audacity to tell me he has to do everything because I ask him to bring me something from the kitchen while he is up and already in the kitchen.  Hmmmm.  He better get this friggin job because I'll be god damned if I have to sell my car so we can get by and I have to drive a junk piece of shit even though I make a ton of money.  Sad, but true, I have to pay for every bill, plus my debt, rent, car payment, vacation fund (which I made a separate one for me) pet costs, food, EVERYTHING.  He even asked if I could use my credit card to buy him toys.  What?  I don't think so asshole.  If I have to do without some things I like, so do you.  I'm contemplating giving up my car, that I worked hard for, but you want to go on buying fucking toys?!  Not going to happen!
