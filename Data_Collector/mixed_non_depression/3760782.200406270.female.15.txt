 I have started a Mel Brooks guild on gaia. So far it only has three members(including me) but what should I expect? Overall, so far so good.  The only prior experiance I've had with guilds(or any sort of online roleplay thing) is Neopets.  I remember starting out at Neopets....it was one of the last days of school during 6th grade...my friend Heather introduced it to me. I became instantly hooked to it(and so did anyone else I convinced to join, lol)  I wasted more than three years of my life there....and I've had at least six seperate accounts, on two diffrent e-mail adresses.(if you want one, PM me on gaia and we'll work out some sort of deal, I'm on a quest and I don't feel like giving anything away for free, lol)  Over time, things got a bit tedious and dull. For those of you reading this and are on Neopets, you know what I mean. You have to play their stupid flash games in order to gain neopoints(their currency) and I just don't have the patience for that anymore. Inflation, one of the negitive aspects of most economies, had gotten extremely high, so items became difficult to afford. So eventually, I just gave up. That, and I outgrew their whole 'kiddie' image.  Now about the guilds....I had created at least 10 or more guilds on that site, and the members almost always consisted of the friends in my seventh grade classes. Boy, I was glad they were around. Hell, I still talk to a couple of them on gaia.  ......wow this was long and pointless...perhaps I should continue with this tommorow, ne?
