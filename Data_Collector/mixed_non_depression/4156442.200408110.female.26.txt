 God!! If I could go back in time I would go to a sperm bank instead of having to deal with a dumb$$ baby daddy! well at one point he was my husband but now he has the title of baby daddy if I could call him that! Some men are so worthless that they make some women turn lesbians! I have tried in every way to deal with him and nothing! I tried been nice, getting angry and basically not giving a f***! and nothing! I get no emotion from him but some how everything is my fault! and I guess he is right, cause its my fault I got involved with him sorry a$$! The only thing that upsets me now is that my son is growning up with out a dad! Financially we don't need him cause I have a good job, but a child always need his two parents and when one is out, well there is only soo much the other parent can do. And sad to say that I know I'm not the only women dealing with a sorry baby daddy and the thing is that he isn't hurting me but he is hurting someone he created and has his same blood, his SON!! Maybe us as women are more connected with our emotions and I couldn't picture not seeing my son for months and men just go on with their life without a care about it! Clubbing and living the single life when we have to stay home and be responsible mothers and take care of our kids with double responsibilities cause while they are out creating more babies! All I know is that I'm doing the best I can and my son will know that I gave him everything he needed...and he will also know that his dad choose not to participate in his life....and as for his dad, well---- PAYBACK IS A B****!!!! ONE DAY HE WILL GET HIS!
