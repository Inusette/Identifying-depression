 What would you do if an ex came by the house, you are with a new person and that person is SO upset that they might leave you?  So upset at the fact that he doesn't want to talk to you, kiss you, or touch you.  You tell him not to worry about the ex, you wouldn't do anything to destroy your relationship with them. They are your first true love, never find anyone better than them. But still, they are so mad, rub it in your face that you were even with that person. Will make love to you but right in the middle all the heat disappears and cant finish. You say its ok, everything will be ok, but its not. I can understand what he is going through, although not sure I would take it so far. I tell him this, still no help. I tell him that he is my world, my best friend, my everything. I could never want a man as much as I want him...But still no help. The relationship already has a ton of troubles..Kids, work, money, his ways, my ways..Average things. But when you add the fact that he doesn't trust you, to the point that he makes himself sick, what do you do?  Get to the point that they are treating you badly as to block the pain if you do hurt them...Does that really help? Or does it make it worse? You don't like to be treated badly, you where in a relationship that was like that for 6 years, you thought that this person would be different, treat you like a queen. But when they get like this, what do you do? Deal with it until it makes you a bitch? Resentful, hurt, angry.......       They realize that they did you wrong, but the damage is done, the hurt will never go away. How many times can you hear "Im Sorry" before you realize that its a easy way out. That "Im sorry" doesn't cut it anymore. If they were sorry they would stop doing it repeatedly and change their ways. Maybe they are sorry, but can they really be if they say it so many times and not do anything about the way they are acting?
