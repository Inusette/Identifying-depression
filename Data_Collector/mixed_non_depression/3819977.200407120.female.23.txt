 I’d like to share a quote I particularly like:   	“We find comfort among those who agree with us - growth among those who don’t.” 									- Frank A. Clark  How are we ever suppose to grow and learn if we are constantly surrounded by people who agree with us?  When you sit and discuss a topic with someone else who has an opposing view you will learn more from that one person than if you sat and discussed that same topic with 10 other people who believe what you do.  Although, I have found some very interesting conversations start up between people with the same views who are just pondering other possibilities.  I have a friend who is interested in the building sciences like I am, the two of us can get together and just bounce back ideas about what if this were to happen or if this one thing changed wouldn’t that make a huge difference to the houses and buildings going up right now?  It’s really cool to have someone on the same wavelength as you.  But, as far as growth goes, I feel I learn more by talking to someone about a topic that we are opposed on rather than have the same feelings.  When I come across a good conversation like this I’ll try to remember to share it.
