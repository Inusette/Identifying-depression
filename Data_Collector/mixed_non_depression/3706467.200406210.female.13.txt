 O.K. let's get this stright first. I am a total Drake Bell Fan. I have tons of pictures of him in my room. I think If Drake would ask me to do something (even if it was so stupid) I would do it. I am his #1 fan. I also like Mary-kate and Ashley but not as much as Drake. I am also in 4-h and this year (it's my first year) and I am showing a llama named Fozzoli. I am involved in church and I am also homeschooled. Home-schooling stinks sometimes but it's ok. Like I only have 2 hours of school. This was our first year and I think we are going to be doing it again next year. This summer our cousin Ashley is staying with us. Oh yeah, I also have a brother. And a mom and Dad. My brothers name is Andy. I have lots of pets too. I have 1 bird (I used to have 3 but 1 had only one nostril and one lung and his name was Sammy,and the other one ,Princess , ran into the t.v. 2 days ago and broke her neck and died.) oh, the bird that alive, her name is Cinnimon. I have 20 fish (we don't really name them). I have 2 dogs Pokey and Flash (Pokey is 2 and Flash is 13), the're  bassets. I have 1 cat named Baby. 1 Ferret named Teddy. 3 Sugar-gliders named Woodstock, Chip, and Dale. Oh yeah, and sometimes I count my brother as a pet. Sometimes  I like to babysitt for people. I really like watching kids, I guess it's my thing. I play the guitar. I have a lavender Fender Stradicaster. And I say I am really good at it. I think I am going to start a band with my friend Amie, she plays the drums. I think we would be a great band. And mabey we will get to meet Drake Bell and mabey he'll like us so we will go on tour with him and then he'll fall in love with me and then he'll marry me and we'll have 2 girls and... I think I am going a little nuts. I think we would make a great band though. I also dont have a boyfriend. Oh, and I am 13 year old girl. If I forogt anything I will be online tomarrow to inform you any more.
