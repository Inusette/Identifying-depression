 I woke up today and everything seemed perfect, but as the day passed, little incidents occured, very little, but a lot of them, mean classmates, embarrasing moment in the cafeteria, lots of homework, boring classes, a chewgum stuck in my braces  .  Note to self:  Never eat chewgum again as long as I have these stupid braces, it took me like an hour to take it off!
