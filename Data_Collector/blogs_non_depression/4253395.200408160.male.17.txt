 I'm sorry if you're unfortunate enough to be reading this...guess you got bored while talking to me. Anyways, my last blog died because i forgot my handle AND password and i forgot which email i used, so oh well. I'll update this one more, I PROMISE! Ok....  My name is Zack. Im a big band dork. I play trumpet in marching band and jazz band, and snare in winter drumline.  I'm a pretty laid back person almost all of the time. You've gotta piss me off pretty good to get a reaction out of me. I've been getting really close to several people in the past month or so, and hopefully one a little more than the rest. My goal is to spend as much of my senior year just hanging out with people as much as possible. uhh....what else is there....did i mention im a loser? lol really, i am...  Individual shouts: (IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER!) andrew h. : You dont seem as stupid this year.... Squirmy: Ditto, although you werent as stupid as the aforementioned character.... Colleen (aka dimples, aka nicotine): You're awesome, and i can't wait to see how stuff turns out rachel (aka pommer, aka twitchy): You're a good friend to talk to, thanks for listening to me be                                                             a moron mallory (aka featherhead): lol, you're just mallory...thanks for being fun and funny and talking                                                with me christy: we've been through a lot, and im glad things have finally smoothed out. i wish you and                 tim the best. joe: you're a kickass friend, WE MUST KICK ASS THIS WINTER SEASON! tess: you rock claire: you're very cool to talk to....and make up insane stories with while insanely tired on a tour            bus  Theres a ton of people that would be on this list if i wasnt so damn tired right now. Like i said, no order...in fact, after i thought of people in order i rearranged them.
