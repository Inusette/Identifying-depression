 Okay.. This is my first blog ever. I know i'm so not with the times. I'm like in the stone age. I'm so not a computer person so let's see how all this shit goes ay. Well i actually wrote some shit just then but yeah.. I did something which i have no idea what and yeah deleted all the crap i wrote..ahhh!! This always happens to me. I'm so born not to touch computers.. haha! Okay. It's Sat nite and guesse what Shermaine's doing?? Nothing!! Yeah it's a hell fucking moodless day for me today. Practically slept the whole day. I came home bout 1-ish from work last nite. I stayed late cuz we were all just hanging out and all. They wanted me to go over to one of their place's today, and yeah i didnt' go cuz i was sleeping and also i'm kinda afraid of getting close to any of them cuz they are my boss anyways and yeah i really don't want myself shining through too much cuz i might get fired. haha! But don't get it wrong.. I'm not a fake person infront of them at all. I'm just drawn-back a tiny bit. But yeah they're awesome people and we all get along real well so that's all good. Guesse what?? I might meet Chris tommoz. Well, we were meant to go on a road trip.. Road Trip!! But yeah I don't know.. things always get cancelled with us. But that's cool i understand i guesse.. I don't really know Chris as well as i wish i did but nah he's a sweetie. He's outgoing and he's hot!! ;) haha.. I don't think tomorrow will happen but we'll see how it goes. If not, I'd prob go to the city wit my friends from my old high school. Haven't seen them in agess!!! It's weird.. i thought i'd never lose contact with them but it's actually really hard cuz everyone's doing their own thing and yeah it's not easy. But yeah i will definitely make an effort to catch up with them every now and then. We got to! Okay, John Lennon's on telly and i wanna watch it.
