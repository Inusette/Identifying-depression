 Woohoo! My Very First Blog. I'm so happy. Now I'm gonna' spill my heart out like a naive little 3 year old! Or something like that.  So Today was the last actual day of school. I'm so happy, now we've got finals to do. What fun. I've got Japanese and Computer Literacy. We did nothing at school today whatsoever. It was really retarded, but it was fun, cause the teachers were somewhat intimidated and forked over tons of candy in a last ditch to maintain some semblance to order.  It worked.  During Science, M*rr*s (take that Google!) was a meanyhead, making me take the darn remote and fast forward through commercials, then count field trip money, then do this, and that, and so forth. Me no like M*rr*s. Oh well. SHE'S GONE FOREVER FROM MY LIFE AFTER THIS. I'm so freakin' happy.  History was kinda' stupid, but Micah and I chased each other around, and Ms. Yi got pissed. Japanese was kool, cause Austin and I got to sumo wrestle or something like it. Everyone was goofing off. It was awesome.  CS, I was locked in a room with Sm*th for a whole period. I was scared. He's still pissed at me, I think. Here's where background is required. He was dissing Mozilla (!), and how they were heralding ThunderBird as the next generation of email thing. Then he proceeds to diss all of Mozilla, including Composer and FireFox. Then, the final straw, he calls ThunderBird FireBird. So I tell him he's wrong and tell him that FireBird was the 1st generation of the  FireFox browser. He just kinda' stares at me. So I'm not sure whether he was really, really pissed or amazed that someone as computer illiterate as me would know that.  Skipping all other classes, I get to English with B*l*sta, 8th Period. I tried to behave in class, and this is the 4th day of the year that I managed to actually pay attention!!! But I got this pencil, and wrote on my binder, "Blinder than a Mother-Freakin' Doorknob" with an arrow pointing to my right.   Ms. B*l&sta walks over and has her back to me. She gives a really long, like  5 minute lecture with me holding this next to her. It was picture perfect, and Micah nerly died laughing. No kidding.  At home, I IM'd and got in fights w/ my parents. Nothing else                                         Lotsa' Love (or something like that)
