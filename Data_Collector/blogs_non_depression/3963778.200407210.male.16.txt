 Being really bored again... I shall post.    Yesterday I went on a date with Elise. We went to see King Arthur. The theatre was nearly empty because it was 4pm on a Tuesday, but these two fat men sat a seat away from us. I think I counted 7 other people in the whole theatre. Not to mention one of these guys got on his cell phone for about 30 minutes. HOLY SHIT!!! I swear, some people need to be shot. Anyways, after the movie we sat in the parking lot debating about where to eat. Of course Elise refused to contribute, except for places within eyesight, so I had to choose. We finally went to Orlando's  where we proceded to eat overpriced (but very very good)  food. Afterwards we went to Elise's mom's house cuz her mom had made a chocalate cake. I stayed for about an hour then went home. I would have stayed longer, but I didnt want to overstay my welcome (especially since I havent been there in quite some time). All in all, I think the whole thing went pretty good.   Today I woke up at noon, which I HATE doing, but I was so tired. Yesterday I had to wake up really early to take Olivia to someone's house cuz my dad was going out of town. He goes out of town almost every week for his job. Olivia goes over to one of my dad's friend's house so I dont have to be chained down watching her. There are 4 other kids there which she gets along with fairly well, but she always wants to come home. Go figure. Our house is so boring.   Well, I gotta go figure out what to make for dinner. I didnt plan on Olivia being home so everything is frozen. Dinner should be interesting tonight.
