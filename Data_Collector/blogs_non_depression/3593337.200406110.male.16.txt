 Again, Not a lot happened to me today. It started off regularly, showered,got dressed, ate and so forth. Then I decided to play MSN before I went to school. I saw that Kendra was on so we talked about the hot gossip in town... it was mainly about the Jarret and Sarah and their new found love. I got to school abit on the late side, but I just had Bio so I didn't give a damn. Then we skip ahead to 3:15, because school is gay and I don't want to talk about it. I really felt like doing something after school just because I didn't want to go home. But everyone was preoccupied so I had no other choice but to go home. I then decided I would go for a drive to kill some time. So I'm driving down main when I see a group of hutterites trying to cross the street. They were already almost half way across when I started slowing down. When they saw me, it was as if I was the Anti-Christ. All 4 of them just start scrambling around. They looked like fucking retards out there. So 2 head back for safety and infront of the Co-op and the other 2 bravely take the risk and proceed to the other side. I was so close to rolling down my window and start yelling at the the retards...Fuckers   That was the most exciting thing that happened to me today.   Then I went over to the school to see what Big K was up to. He was doing some stupid accounting shit with Connie. He asked me to go get his pictures from the Parasave for him. So I did that, then I went over to Radio Shack to see what was new there. Mitch was there but he was TOO BUSY TO TAlk...So I once again left. After about other 5 minutes of driving I got bored and went home. The rest of my night was then followed by, eating, MSN, then homework.   That pretty much sums it all up. I am tired now and ready for bed. Later
