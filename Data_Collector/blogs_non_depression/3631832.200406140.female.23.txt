 I've never been good at keeping a diary, so this may not work out so well.  Today after work, I had a surprise in that Jeff had called and left me a message on my cell phone.  I was very skeptical of ever hearing from him again.  I still do not know what happened over graduation weekend to cause the complete lack of communication between us recently.  I guess at some level I knew that we would never be able to work things out with 800 miles between us.  I was dreaming for a little bit.  I do believe things happen for a reason, however.  I just wish I could figure out the reason for having met James at this time in my life.  It's almost scary how perfect he is for me.  We have the same stupid sense of humor and understand each other perfectly.  I can't imagine him ever being an asshole or us ever staying mad at each other.  Why does he have to move to Texas in 6 weeks?  Long distance just isn't my thing.  So once again, I will get my heart broken and recover only to move on and get it broken again.  Which I guess is the way I prefer it.  I'm too young to settle down with one man.  I just wish I would quit meeting these incredible guys at such wrong times.   When am I going to get a break in love?    On the good side, I had a fabulous weekend.  I am beginning to love my new home here.  The possibilities are endless in this area.  I am making friends and figuring my way around.  Work is good...much better than I had thought it could be.  I guess I am a true geek at heart...who would have known?  I still don't think I could live here for the rest of my life though and be happy.  I think this is a great stepping stone though for 4 or 5 years.  Then it will be off to bigger and better things for me.  Maybe I'll move back home.  Or maybe to Texas... :)  who knows.  I love that I have so many choices in my life.  I really do feel very fortunate to have had all the opportunities in my life that have happened lately.  Life is good.
