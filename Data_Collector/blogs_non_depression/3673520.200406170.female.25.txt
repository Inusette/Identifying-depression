 I need a job. A paying one. Not another unpaid internship where I drive 1.5 hours to get there, do crap work for 5 hours, then drive 1.5 hours to get home.   LA traffic sucks, but at least it's not as bad as Houston traffic. Or rather the drivers aren't nearly as bad. People here pretty much know how to drive. Houstonians DO NOT. They suck. They are rubberneckers to the Nth degree and cut you off and give you the finger. Here, people are calm for the most part and just sit and wait. Much nicer and more stress free.  I like it here. Maybe it's being away from family and friends that I grew up with or something but I think the only way I'll ever have a life of my own is out here. Just being around my family (who honestly are the *best* family anyone could ever hope for) makes me feel all this pressure to be someone or something. I feel like a different kind of person than them and no one has ever really made any effort to "get" me. I'm creative, they're not. They're obsessed with sports, I'm obsessed with tv and movies. When I'm with them I'm down on myself for not being about to get married like my cousins, or because I haven't been seeing the same person for 4 years like my YOUNGER brother. Going home to spend time with them is great, but it always makes me feel like my life is missing something because I'm not like them.   Out here, I fit in. Everyone's creative, everyone's obsessed with tv and movies. People out here have traveled and lived all over. They don't grow up in one town and marry someone they went to high school with.  I'm starting to rack up a list of former hometowns now though. Milford, Connecticut; Wake Forest, North Carolina; Poughkeepsie, New York; Houston, Texas; and Orange County, California! But I like that. It'd be sad to say I only ever lived in Milford or Wake Forest. Even if I don't *settle down* (ohhh how I hate that term) I have good stories to tell whoever'll listen!!
