 Last fridae mi went out wif my dear dear..but things did not turn out the way i wanted it to be..during the movie everithing went smoothly...in fact is the most memorable one..haha..but after the movie..things started to change...my dear dear decided to go play pool and he asked mi whether i wanna go..i said anithing..hence he called his friend..then we go play pool..then since i dunno how to play so i say i dun wanna play lah..i juz see them play..but he keep beggin mi to play..but i insisted not to play..i tink he angry wif mi..haiz..but how can you force something that i dun like doin...??? the last time when i call him play bowlin he oso neva play what..after playing pool he fetch mi home loh..but we become kinda cold to each other..he keep tokin to his friend instead of mi..but at some point of time he got tok to mi..but it juz isn't the same..i tink he noe that im not feelin veri happi..i was feelin kinda hurt to be honest..but i dun wanna tell him anithing..coz i dun wanna hurt his heart...i rather suffer in silence then to break his heart..even though he has broke my heart again and again..but i juz can't help but fall in love with him...its juz beyond my control..haiz...so after we reach my stop..i throw him a hug..but i doubt that he will hug mi if i did not take the initiative to...then when he walk up the stairs i saw him and i wave at him but he did not even wave back..when i told my friends about this they tell mi dun anihow tink..but if ur dear dear did not wave back to you what will you be thinking?? i was feelin angry and veri veri veri hurt..but i can i do?? i simply love him too much..nowadaes we seemed to have change alot..haiz...he aint sayin the things he use to say..and i can't realli adapt to the change..when he aint saying the things he used to say i feel veri uncomfortable...we aint the same when we first started and i am realli afraid that i will lose him...realli realli afraid..haiz..i hope this will not continue and that we will become normal again...haiz...[+LoVe_SiMpLY_hUrTs+]
