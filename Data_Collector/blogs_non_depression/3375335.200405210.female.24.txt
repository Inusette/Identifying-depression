 ok so today has been a pretty good day considering.... The other nanny is going to be gone for the whole day and the baby nanny really doesn't help me all that much... none of the kids were in bed before 9:30 (not my fault) and the mom is home. This morning was fine the kids and I were joking around all the way to school so the day started off with laughs and smiles. Then I took the 3 year old to pre-school and we had no problems... I picked him up we had a good lunch and afternoon he fell asleep right away for his nap and the mom is picking the kids up from school..    I found out yesterday that I passed the praxis which is huge for me cuase now I am a certified teacher in the state of Ohio. Whew!! I also got a call on my way to play practice (more about that later) about a job at a school really close to my home town. I am so excited. The principal isn't even asking me to apply just send her a resume and plan on going in for an interview. I had done an experience there and she wants to hire me.. I am almost about to burst!!  I leave for Fl in like 5 days and I am so ready for it!!   so I have been going to this church here and there are these 3 great fun guys my age there. Well the pastors wife, youth pastors wife and the church secretary have all decided that they want me to stick around here. So it has recently been their goal to hook me up with one of these guys. nice huh... Well I was asked to be in this skit for friend day at church and yup sure enough they are all in it adn I am "married" to one.. yup... so any time I see one of the ladies they say something and i turn bright red.. yea nice..   So Josh Dailey is coming to visit me for the weekend and I am super stoked!! I can't wait to have some fun and see him!!!!  Praise you Lord for the weekend....
