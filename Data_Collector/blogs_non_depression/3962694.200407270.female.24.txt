 I am addicted to blogs!  After reading my friend Beth and Cs's blog, I was intrigued...I had a site on diaryland, but after so much time of not logging in, it was dismanteled, so to say.  Anyway, on Cs's page she has blogs that she reads, and lists as favorites or something like that, so I clicked on a few, and became addicted.  How weird that I can get so excited about logging onto AOL to read about people's lives that I don't even know, and they don't even know that I exist!  Weird, if ya ask me, but nonetheless, I am creating my own in hopes of someone's enjoyment in reading about my somewhat boring, but exciting life, to others...Let us begin shall we?             Yesterday I went shopping, imagine that, me shopping..ha.  I got a dress for the rehersal dinner, an outfit for the bachelorette party and reception...If you don't know, I am in a wedding!!  How exciting...It's for my friend Jamie, a friend that I've known about 20 years...What a great girl she is.  Anyway, went to Wal*Mart afterwards, bought some fun stuff, I love that store, it always has cool little things around there...And of course, they always stare at me saying "buy me, buy me".  Well I was a good girl, bought some scrapping stuff, and some other d0-dads, and I was out of there.  I had today off, went and got my haircut and went into the store (work - CVS/Pharmacy) to see what was going on with the girls.  I am a manager there (well, shift supervisor t0 be exact, but in about a year I'll have my own store as the manager).  Anyway, that was about it, came home, ate dinner, talked to a few people, and scrapped for a few hours, I am working on something special, can't tell ya in case someone reads this, I don't want to spoil a surprise...It's getting kinda late, and I have an 11 hour work day tomorrow, so I am off to the bed.  Sweet dreams r
