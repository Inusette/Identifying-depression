 The main reason I post is to get stuff of my chest, like problems with humans, my damn computer and my shoe ( just a warning, I make corny jokes, blonde jokes and bad taste jokes((Tasmanian))Be warned!)   First I'd like to discuss the monkey that walks like us. They say (zookeepers) that she got brain damage to resulting in walking like a moped. I believe that that we, as humans, are scared that other "beings"(aliens, animals, that sort of thing) are smarter than us. we want to stay on top of the food chain as dominating race. we try to find other life forms, but half heartedly, we cannot cope with others trying to show us good things(if not that, what else?). And the killer whale that turned on its "master", it attacked. What does that tell you? Doesn't it make you wonder what the animals think?                                    regards,                                                      Kitty   P.S. if you want to e-mail me with comments, topics you want me to cover or correspondence I will personally reply.
