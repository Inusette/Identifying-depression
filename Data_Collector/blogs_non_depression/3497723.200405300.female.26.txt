 This is my first attempt at keeping any sort of journal. I have never been very good at keeping any sort of record of my life. I have always had the fear that once an experience is put on paper, the brain no longer has a need to remember it and the memory is thus discarded, or rerouted for use in another way. Therefore, I am rather skeptical to put much of note down here too soon. Perhaps my mind ramblings will be just that, ramblings, nothing more, nothing less. Or, perhaps, I will learn that the more I jot down, the more I will be able to remember. The brain never ceases to amaze me. It remembers things long since forgotten, in a way...Perhaps that is where DeJaVue comes from. I am constantly in a state of rememberance, that is the way that I know I am on the right track in life. Whenever I don't get a memory of something that I am doing that I know I have never done before, I know that what I am doing is that which I am supossed to be doing. My life, otherwise, might get very complicated and then where would I be?  A friend from my childhood has had a very trying life and started blogging to sort things out. I am very proud of her for that. She is who made me decide to try it. I don't really have an outlet for my life, my husband has a hard time understanding my need for higher and higher education. That is not to say that he is not supportive or encouraging by any means, it is just that he felt a Bachelors degree was all that was really needed. I, on the other hand, feel that I need to get more. I am in the process of completing my BA in Molecular Biology and a minor in Chemistry, only to persue a DVM/PhD combo in the next 6yrs.  Perhaps I will obtain that goal, but for now I am just looking forward to finally obtaining my first degree...and it has only me since 1996...3 years sabatical for work and my son...etc, basically life in general... Well, that is it for my first blog, perhaps next time it will be more insightful.
