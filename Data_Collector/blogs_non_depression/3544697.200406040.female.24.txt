We know somebody, from London, his name is Peter and we are staying with him just now in London and he helps us with our english though Minka finds it hard or 'ard (Peter) to understand and I do not understand much better. Peter says this cite should help improve our english so we can go out more!! Stop us that does not!!!    English men are so cool. They funny and make us laugh. There accents please me lots!!
