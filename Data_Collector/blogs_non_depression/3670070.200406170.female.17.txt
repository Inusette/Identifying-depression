 Hahaha!  What an orginal title for this entry!  I don't know what to name it! This is the first time I have writtien in here!  I'm so hungry!  My mimi is making me something to eat.  I really should have eaten a bigger lunch!  Work was so boring!  Me and Adam just sat there the whole time!  There was no one in there watching us and we were so confused half way into the training! We, what we thought was done, didn't know what to do next!  I was walking around with no shoes on in the main office looking for someone to come and help us! LOL!  I finally found someone to help us and we ended up having a ton of lessons to do. They were so stupid.  Poor Adam started nodding off five mintues into his.  Mine wasn't that bad.  I was actually doing my lessons and not falling asleep!  I was trying to learn!  Unfortunately, I have to train AGAIN tomorrow, but Adam isn't going to be there so I am going to be all by myself! :...(      Moving right along!  Haha.. I just found out that Madonna is changing her name to Ester!  Haha! What the hell!! She is f-ing Madonna!  She can't change her name! Blah to her.. I don't like her anyways!  I miss Erik!  He hasn't really been gone that long and only has a week and a couple days before he comes back home.  I can't wait to see him.  I miss him ALOT!  We made our first HUGE decision together yesterday.  We decided on going to Cameron our first year of college and go  to OU our sophomore year.  That works for me.  I really want to go to OU, but I can wait a year.  OU isn't going anywhere!  Haha!  It would be better that we wait to go to OU and we go to Cameron our first year.  That way we can keep our jobs and continue saving money for our appartment and everything.  I am really excited that we made that decision.  I can plan out the next couple of years of my life now.  I just need to tell my dad and start getting everything I need to get into Cameron next fall.      Well, I don't really feel like typing any more!  I've been typing all day of the computers at work!  I will just write tonight and then type it in tomorrow before work. I'm going to go talk to Erik William....                                          June 17th, 2004     Hahahaha.. I chatted on AIM, ate my food, and typed all this!  Damn, I'm getting good at multi-tasking!! Hehehehe!!!
