 Well, this is my second blog, this time I am having a go posting via e-mail!!  What have I been up to?  Well last night I drove home and as it was so sunny I decided to take some pictures of my building to show my Grandma when I next go home.  I rang my Grandma and my sister Sindy.  I have agreed to move in with my sister next year and her boyfriend Art, if I don’t they will have to move.  Their house is really nice, plenty big enough and it would be wonderful living in London.  Plus I think I will feel more ‘settled’ down there.  It would be good for Art too as he will be able to use my car.  I don’t have a job lined up but I have my long term plan sorted:  Temp/bar work and apply for proper jobs, if I don’t get proper job by January, apply for teacher training.  It’ll be fine…..  Last night I also worked on a website for work a little bit and then watched TV.  My house is a tip so tonight I think tonight I will do lots of cleaning and tidying.  I have an interview on Friday for which I should really be revising, but you know, tidying’s better than revising (ask any student!!)  Well today the sun came out again bright and hot.  It’s sad being stuck in an office on a day like this.  I’d love to be stretched out, outside with a book.  Ho hum.  Today is a quiet day at work, this afternoon I may take some more images of phantoms with the gamma camera but for now I’ll just sit here and try and do some theory.  Roll on the weekend I say!!!
