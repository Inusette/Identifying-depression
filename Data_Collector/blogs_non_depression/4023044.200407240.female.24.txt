 I'm sitting in a wading pool in Paul's backyard on a sweltering 100 degree day in Portland. Tomorrow I leave for the San Juan islands on a two week trip with 12-14 year olds. I am savoring every moment of relaxation I have in my thirty-six hours off, though it is always difficult to resist the call of the lengthening to-do list.  In college Cynthia and I were going to make a think tank called Brains in a Vat. We would lie around thinking and writing and solve the world's problems. Right now I don't feel like I have very many solutions to the world's problems, but if I could sit around all day and think I would surely come up with something phenomenal. The blogger address brainsinavat.blogspot was taken, which makes me wonder if someone else is usurping our idea. I had to take Brains in a Jar. Too bad. What will I do if they are conservative assholes using "Brains in a  Vat"? Closed-minded, tightass brains in a vat. I bet their logo isn't as nice as ours. I can see it now: Brains in a Jar versus Brains in a Vat. Two thinktanks battling head to head for funding. I guess if they can solve the world's problems before we can, I should commend them.  Thirty-seven days left of my job. My mom suggeested that I count them down on my calendar to make the time seem more manageable. Thirty-seven days seems very far from manageable right now. I know I can do it and I know that I am helping them out by giving so much advanced notice, but some days I kick myself for not just giving two weeks notice like everyone else in America.  Paul's last day at work is July 31. I have guilt pangs about us both being unemployed at the same time because I know how that must look to our employers. I didn't quit my job to have time for Paul. I quit my job to have time for me. For my health. For grad school. For my future.  But they don't know that.  And it sure is going to be nice . . .
