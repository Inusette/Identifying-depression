 it's right. love don't come easy. that's what phil collins is telling us in his song "you cant hurry love". and i always hear this line from my friend, jan. but this don't bother me before... until it came to me. however, i wont get tired of waiting for love to come. i know that even the reason i cried before was love, it's still love that will make me smile again.  hmm, why do i often caught myself smiling alone these days? well, maybe, the love is coming to me now. =)
