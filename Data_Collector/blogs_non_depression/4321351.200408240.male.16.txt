 i get to go to practice tonite. im gonna call eryn later and sing to her, but i dont know what yet. im thinking maybe i dont wanna miss a thing, but ill prolly come up with something better by then. My head hurts so bad, and its my fault because i kissed her when she had a cold. Thats what happens, people tell me not to do stuff, but do i listen? No. Why? Because i have the attention span of a squirrell. i hope we get to the end of the show tonite. speaking of which, i have to get going! my head hurts so fucking bad. i think i might barf, which will be cool, because ill barf all over jarrod. he'd enjoy it. school sucked today, just like any other day. it wasnt as bad as my orange days, becuase i had "a" lunch and i had mr roach in class today and he told the funniest joke. but i pulled an eryn and forgot it in favor of a story which eventually unfolded into this update. oh, im going to be posting from my previous journal, so dont freak out if you see an entry on here from June. YOURE NOT TRAVELLING BACKWARD IN TIME! i have to go now. wow, saying goodbye to this blog is almost as hard as saying goodbye to eryn. im not gonna kiss the computer, tho. i dont love it as much as i love eryn, and itll prolly give me a bug too.
