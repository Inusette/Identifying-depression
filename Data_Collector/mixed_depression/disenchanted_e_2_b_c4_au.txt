The last few weeks I have slid back almost as far as before I started treatment. Just when I thought I was improving.

I finally went to the drop in center called Sunshine Place, as someone was giving a talk on depression. The counselor spoke with me for about half an hour after her talk and said she thought I needed more help than my GP was giving. For the first time in a few months I actually broke down and cried again - which is very annoying to me. She wrote down the number of the Mental Health Center with some suggestions for them. I rang the next day for an appointment (and that was hard just to ring). She had told me I might have to wait a few weeks for them to see me, but they made an appointment for the next day.

The psychiatirst there was okay (I didn't even cry like I normally do when talking to a new doc) but I told her I was tired of telling the same things to every new person. The short of it is they are changing me from Lexapro to Avanza and organizing for some CBT. I see my regular GP next Tuesday so I am pleased they said they would inform her of the medication change. I was also warned that I would probably feel a bit more depressed while the medication change was taking place; so I duly warned Mom and Matt not to take any notice of any strange behavior. Matt as usual just laughed and said "yeah, Mom's going to go psycho". 
Now I just wait for them to contact me about the CBT.

If I don't answer any posts you'll know why, but I will try to just put a little emoticon up every now and then to let you know I am thinking of you all, and that I am still listening.
