One of the biggest things i'm struggling with (besides my depression duh) is finding a good therapist. I moved about 6 months ago, and I have not had luck finding a therapist that I can work well with. I know that I need help with cognitive therapy, and i've gone to a couple therapists who have cognitive listed as a specialty, but when I get into therapy with them, its all talk therapy with little to no help to me. Don't get me wrong, talking does help, but I know from my years of dealing with this illness that I need some good solid cognitive therapy to help me to overcome my lack of self n worth / self n esteem / confidence.

Also, has anyone had any luck with alternative therapies?
