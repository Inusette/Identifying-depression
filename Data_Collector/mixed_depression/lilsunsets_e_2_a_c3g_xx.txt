I was wondering what people's viewpoints are on for being on medication ...

because it seems like getting the right combo of medications seem tricky and if you don't get the right combination, you still remained depressed ... or worse than before? 

I'm curious to know what the myths .. vs non myths about antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, etc?   Do they make you feel worse?  They say that the medications generally make you feel more like yourself than different ...  but it takes some 6 months to get attuned to them?  Is that correct?

I've been trying to fight off my depression for over 10 years - I think it's a factor from childhood abuse.  In recent years, perhaps my nerves have grown thin ... and I'm slowly wearing myself out ...  my friends have recommended more therapy since I see a school counselor once every two weeks.   But it's difficult to really focus on my emotion health when I know that I'll be relocated in two months  .. and I feel that my current emotional stability is just shaky.. 

Is it advisable to start medications without therapy and then when I relocate to wherever I find a job ... then begin therapy there?  (In other words, I've never been on medications before)

Any advice would be helpful.
