The only thing I do is hurt people and say dumb things when I'm mad (really I'm so mad at myself and hate myself so much it seeps out towards others). I know that makes me a very ugly and hateful person.

I don't know how to deal with this anymore. This last year has been the worst (mood problem - wise). I used to have longer periods of relative normalcy in between episodes, but they seem to be happening more frequently this past year. It's too much to deal with.

I am getting treatment and seeing a doctor, but nothing seems to work that great for me. My doctor probably thinks I'm faking it all at this point. I don't really think she has experience treating anything but very mild depression or anxiety.

I feel so low right now. I just don't know or care anymore. What do I do?
