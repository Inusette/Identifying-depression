  I just turned 18 and a couple of months have gone by and everything is a mess. I feel so paranoid about everything; that I'm going to die. That every feeling ache or pain is something horrible. Sometimes I just feel like I might have a heart attack and die and I'm just so afraid! I can't sleep alone at night anymore. I feel week and helpless and I hate it. I feel selfish that I'm so worried about myself. Everything has just hit me so hard and I don't know why, and although I've seen doctors and she told me "oh I'm too young to be feeling this way, too young to take medicine" I just cant shake it. I'll be seeing a psychiatrist soon too, all my loved ones give me constant reassurance, but I just cant push all these horrible things out of my head. I don't want to cry anymore or feel like this I just want to feel like myself again ...

 ... I'm just looking for someone who understands. Has anyone been through this, these feelings? How do you cope?? Argh ... well... I'm sorry but thank you for your time and patience ... I'm new to this forum .. in fact my first forum post ever written, just hope I can find a little advice ...
