I hope this posts ... I am not feeling good at all. I feel as if I am an outer shell filled with fire that I can not let out. It hurts so much and I don't know what to do. I keep praying but I can't seem to be able and control it. I don't feel worthy. Even this post will probably be deleted. It probably will be because all I ever do is never good enough. I try to try but nothing ever happens. I go to therapy, she said I have 14 personalities ... I hate myself so much right now. I agree not to get on one forum then I go to another ... am I addicted to sadness? Grief? I hate myself so much. I am sick of myself and I just want to scream. Why do I think this way ...
