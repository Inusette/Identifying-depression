new to the forum and just like to share my depression with you all.

I was verbally abused at school from the age of 9 right the way up until i left school, at the age of 10 i self - harmed because i felt worthless not wanted and thick. at the age of 13 my dad left, at the age of 15 i took cannabis to get me through school, people at school used to pick on me everyday "for nothing" i'd come home with tears dripping from my face go to my bedroom and cut myself with bits of glass. then at 16 the last year in school i used to get drunk before i went into school this helped me for a while it was the only thing i could rely on.

anyway i'm now 19 years old and have a list of problems such as: Social phobia / Mild Agoraphobia, Anxiety problems, Depression, Paranoia, Delusions and Insomnia "what a list eh!!"

I don't want to play this sick board game we call life, i don't want anything from life it has nothing to offer me. i've lost count of all the times i have wanted to kill myself. I don't trust anyone i have no friends and i just want to be in total solitude.
Why can't people accept the fact i don't want to socialize? Why is that so wrong?
I want to die but i can't at the moment because that would hurt my Mom, i'm stuck on what to do i just want to be put out of my misery i cant see i future for me.

sorry for babbling on, i hope people reply talk soon
