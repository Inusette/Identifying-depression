I've been on many medications in the past.  I was on Cymbalta last year for about a year.  Then I had a relapse and depressed again.  I changed to Effexor.  The meds never really work for me, I think maybe I am medication - resistant.  Maybe it is working and I don't realize, and maybe I'd be much worse without the meds??

Has anyone tried both Cymbalta, and Effexor?  Which one helped more?  or are they about the same. Should I go back to Cymbalta??  Has anyone quit a medication, tried something else, then went back to that same medication?  or should I try a different medication all together? 

In past, I've tried Zoloft, Lexapro (allergic),  I am on Wellbutrin now with Effexor, also tried Paxil, Luvox, and Celexa.
