Well, it is nearly time.
I swore to myself that I will not be dealing with depression by the time I will be 40.
Shit, my 39th is toddling along shortly, so I will have only one more year to keep my promise.

Gee, no idea whether I be able to make it, but I swore to myself that I have to have the darn depression stuff under my wings by then.

So, keep your fingers crossed for me. The clock is ticking .. 

PS: heh, heh, just thought, since I LOOK nearly 80 presently, maybe I could get a bonus day or two of extension, because of the depressing reflection in mirrors. What do you think?
