I began taking Lexapro 2 months ago and have fallen into a state of deeper depression.  What was at one time characterized purely by chronic migraines has turned into anxiety, sleeping continuously, etc., all the classic depression symptoms.

The scary part is, I'll just have a thought pop into my head like "I have all the pain killers in the house to kill myself right now." Or, I thought, a bath sounds nice, then this sinister thought, "just slip under the water". My rational brain is saying I would absolutely never hurt myself, so why these thoughts?  WHAT THE HECK ??!

My Doc is thinking it's a side effect of the the Lexapro and is taking me off of it.  Have any of you had this experience with this or any other medication?  What if this happened while I was driving a car with my kids??  I truly feel psychotic!!
