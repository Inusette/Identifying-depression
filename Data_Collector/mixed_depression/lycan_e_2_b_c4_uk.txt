I don't know if doing this right, but putting it down 'on paper' gets it out of my head, at least temporarily, and i'm dying inside.
i'm trapped!
i feel so low, unwelcome familiar thoughts in my head, and nowhere to turn.
my two teenage kids in bed, my bloke away at his kids for weekend, I want to cry, but can't anymore. Don't want to bring anyone down with my feelings but so lonely at moment.
life has nothing new to offer me and it seems so easy to leave it all, but how can I when i have two beautiful kids upstairs. Can't do that to them, and that's why i feel so low. hate life, always have. feel comfortable in depression after a while and that's when i get to point of not caring who i hurt. had several episodes through teens and adult life, drink used to help, unemployment let me be selfish, being single mom meant i didn't have to explain my feelings, but this is first episode since been with partner of 3 years. he won't understand, and i just dread tomorrow when he comes home.
just want to sleep and never wake up. trapped, angry I'm trapped, feel selfish for feeling this way, and that makes me even angrier.
any parents out there understand what i mean?
