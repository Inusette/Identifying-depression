I'll first tell you what happened just in case no one read the previous posts about it.

well I went camping with a friend I didn't want to go and I hate her ..

I had a bit of alcohol and started passing out and my friend started touching me .. etc. I feel sick every time I see her and fail to face her anytime I know she's near.

I confided in my 2 closest friends but one of them don't understand at all. she says I have to face my fears when I see her in school and dread walking past her or near her. My friend doesn't realize that I feel physically sick and shaky when I'm near her.

I just can't explain to her that it's not a phobia like spiders or what ever she truly annoys me and I don't know what to do.
