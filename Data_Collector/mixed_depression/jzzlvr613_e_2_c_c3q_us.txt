I am  61 and for almost two years have been dealing with anxiety. It is strange the way of hitting and I would like to know from some of you experts if it is typical GAD.

For almost two years I have been awakened almost every day at about 5:30 out of sound sleep with this feeling of anxiety. At first it hit my spine, now my stomach. If I take a xanax it will dissipate and not bother me much until later in the day. Again, no matter what I am doing I can feel it start to build, take a xanax and go on with life. By late afternoon it is gone and doesn't return until the next day.

During this period my thyroid has been going haywire, probably from four surgeries in four years, the last being two months ago...a total knee repacement.. About sox weels before this surgery, after changing my thyroid meds a bit, the anxiety had left me. I was fine through the operation and then about three weeks after, it was back!

Before the operation I was beginning to get some real bouts of rolling depression but they are gone for now ... just anxiety. The thing that I question is that it is the same no matter what is or has happened in my life for the day. I can have a great, relaxed day or a hectic, chaotic day and the next day will be exactly the same. My environment doesn't seem to affect it. Is all of this typical of GAD or should I redress my thyroid or other hormonal screw ups? Thanks for reading. It's really getting me down!
