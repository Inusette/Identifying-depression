i have suffered from depression for a long time and used to self harm while i was at school.

things seemed to be getting better, i got a job, boyfriend and was a lot happier.

but lately I've just got fired, me and my boyfriend are splitting up, i lost 3 of my pet rats in a short period of time.

everything is going downhill and i can't seem to stop it. I've been thinking more and more about self harm again. i can't help it. i just can't take it all anymore.

 

i guess i just had to tell someone. someone who will understand and not be judgmental and just say, don't do that again, as it isn't as easy as that as I'm sure you all know.
 

ETA: i haven't cut for a few years. but the temptation is too much at the moment.
