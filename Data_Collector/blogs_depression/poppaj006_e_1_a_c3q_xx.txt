i am 20 years old. i work a landscape job. my girlfriend who is pregnant lives 3 hours away. i love her to death and plan on marriage but i cannot stop thinking of her past sex life. Its small numbers and very insignificant compared to my past but for some reason i cant brush it off. i wish we were each others' first and so does she.

we fight constantly, mostly because I'm so irritable and defensive. She's happy in cosmetology school. i think I'm jealous of seeing her so happy with life and me hating it so much. i feel like i have no goal in life. I'm going to try to become a tattoo artist and move down there to be with her soon. we are amazing in person but when we are apart it is horrible. i went from living near her to far away and i hate it. i think about her all day at work and can't talk to her because i don't have a phone at work. i can't stop digging into her past.

when we do fight i hurt myself and it makes me feel better. i cant afford professional help or medicine because i have no insurance. i am getting better and i am happy that I'm moving with her. but what do i do until then?
