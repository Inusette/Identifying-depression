I have lived with depression since I was little. I was molested by my uncle and a family friend and my dad is in and out of prison all the time (I'm guessing that is where it all started from). Well, when I hit my freshman year in high school, I had no friends because I was so shy. I walked the halls alone, went to lunch alone, sat in the back of the classroom alone. I sat back there fantasizing about suicide and death, and I would cut myself, and I actually planned my suicide. By this point I was so far "out of my mind" that I couldn't take it anymore, so I went to my mom. I was diagnosed with severe depression, and I've been in counseling on and off ever since. I am now 18 years old, and I have made friends since, and i even got a boyfriend. Well. I haven't seen my counselor for a while now, and in the past few months I feel like my depression is worse than it has ever been. So many things have been happening to me, that I just can't take it anymore. I lost the friends that I had, and I don't even know why exactly. My boyfriend just broke up with me, after we had been together for two years. I've started to cut myself again. i want to be dead. I know I should go to see my counselor, and i tried to make an appointment, but i feel it's too late. i feel like I'm on the edge of a huge cliff, and if I get pushed just a little more, I'm done. i don't know what to do, I just cant take it anymore! If someone could please just give me some advice I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you, Misty
