I am a 31 year old mom of 5. I have a 25 year history of anxiety, depression and OCD. I have spent years of my life trying antidepressant drugs and anti anxiety medications to help with the symptoms but I have been labeled treatment resistant. I either have side effects that I can't tolerate off of the drugs or they just don't work for me.

I walk around every single day either feeling lifeless, numb, helpless, angry or detached from my family. I have no support from my family as I am estranged from my abusive parents and my sisters are not interested in my emotional problems. To make matters worse I suffer from seizures, migraines and asthma which cause me to be prone to bronchitis and pneumonia. I spend a lot of time sick and in pain.

I have five kids to raise. Two of them are disabled. They have severe speech disorders that make them behave in a negative way. It makes me feel frustrated. My oldest daughter has problems in school because she is having problems with her vision. She may have dyslexia.

I never get out of the house except to go to Walmart or the grocery store. I can't drive because of my seizures and my husband never keeps a consistent schedule. I am housebound and lonely. I see a therapist when I can and he has actually told me he is amazed I haven't killed myself by now with the stress I am under. I am burnt out and sinking fast. Does anyone have any good advice for me?

I do not have a support network so forget about that. I can't make it to support groups so that is out. I am alone except for my children and my computer addicted husband. Please help me figure out how to cope with my life. Right now I am dealing with my new seizure medication and the ongoing problem I am having with hair loss for no apparent reason. I am very depressed about it.

Any advice is appreciated. Please don't take this as me whining about my life. I really am not. I am just trying to figure out where my place is in all of this confusion.
