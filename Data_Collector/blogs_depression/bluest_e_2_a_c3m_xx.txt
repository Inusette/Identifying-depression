I am 20 year old female. I have been on numerous antidepressant and anxiety medicine since I was 11 years old. I never had a problem with sexual dysfunction because 1) I had never been in a serious relationship, 2) I had never been sexual with someone. Now that I am in a sexual, serious relationship, I am having problems. I believe this is a result of Lexapro. I have never had a problem orgasming (at least not to this extent) and I have been on Zoloft, Prozac, you name it, etc. (These medicines were changed because they were either making me too drowsy or simply weren't working). During the summer, I was only on Wellbutrin and had no problem orgasming. However, due to overwhelming anxiety during the start of the school year, I started taking Lexparo and continued the Wellbutrin. Ever since I added Lexapro, I have had an EXTREMELY delayed orgasm, or no orgasm at all. It is really frustrating.  My doctor suggested switching medicine, but since Lexapro is working so well for me as far as anxiety goes, I said I'd rather not. I can't lower my dose because I am on the starting dose for both Wellbutrin and Lexapro. He said I could switch to Effexor or another SSRI medicine, but I may have the same sexual dysfunction.

I was just wondering if anyone here has had a successful combination of Wellbutrin plus an anxiety medication that didn't cause such extreme sexual dysfunction.
