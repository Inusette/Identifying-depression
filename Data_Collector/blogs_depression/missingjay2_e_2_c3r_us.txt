When I was 16 I was raped by my boyfriend. I was a virgin at the time and it was really hard to accept that this had happened to me. I thought that somehow if I didn't say anything to anyone or raise a fuss about it it wasn't true. But it only made it worse. When I tried to break up with him he tried to kill me. We worked together and that made it really difficult to avoid him. He told all his friends at work that I had "given it up to him" which wasn't true. I was mocked and teased by the people that i felt had grown to be my family. 

Now, five years later it is still something that hangs tightly in my mind and heart. It is very hard for me to trust anyone and good relationships have been few. I still look over my shoulder thinking he is going to be there again, following me, stalking me, preying on me.
