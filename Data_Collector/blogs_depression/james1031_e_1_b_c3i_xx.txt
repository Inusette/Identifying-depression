Well I'm new here so here goes nothing.

I have been diagnosed clinically depressed, along with obsessive compulsive disorder.  I'm 32 years old.   I've been divorced once and have since re - married.  I have 2 children, 7 year old boy (stepson) and 4 1/2 year old girl.  I work for a state government agency repairing computers.

So far so good right?  Well the major problems I'm having is becoming a social recluse.  I have a REALLY hard time "letting things go".  In 2005, I lost both my sister (suicide) and my father (heart attack), and those events only added to the trauma I'd been going through.  I live in a small town, so when I went to the doctor about possible ADHD (i was moody, couldn't focus on work, couldn't complete tasks on time etc), they determined I was bipolar and put me on Effexor and Wellbutrin.  Well that just did absolutely nothing.  In fact my anger with the world increased dramatically and I had rage episodes that about destroyed my second marriage.  I've had a lot of rage in the past.  Recently I haven't had any outbursts.  I'm currently taking Cymbalta and Celexa and that seems to be a good combination.   But I still have a hard time going to work, and functioning throughout the day.  I'd rather stay at home, in my bedroom, away from people most of the time.  That's what bothers me.  I'm on antidepressants, but it doesn't seem to help me get motivated to face the world.  Does that come from within?  Is there no magic pill that will all of a sudden make me feel confident? 

I guess that's good enough for now.  I have a ton of mental history but don't want to flood anybody.
