I am 30 years old and I've been living with depression as long as I can remember (I think it started when I was 10) . However I was diagnosed with major depression only 2 years ago. Since then I've experienced recurrent episodes of depression. I thought that knowing what was my problem, accepting it, taking medication, seeing a therapist, working on cognitive therapy, would make my life better. Unfortunately, I still have those major episodes of depression where I'm hopeless and sad, and the only solution available to stop the pain seems to kill myself. No fun in there.

I know that depression is part of who I am, I know it's part of my life and I accept it. What I cannot accept is the fact that it's not going to be easier. I need hope. I need to hear from people who have had recurring depression (not just on episode) and have been able to deal with it and are able to enjoy life.

Please tell me it's possible.
