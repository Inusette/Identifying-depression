In college (10 years ago) I was the victim of a gang rape. I've read up quite a bit and identified with all the stages and normal reactions... I went through the self blame, and guilt, and anger, and depression, and I came to realize it wasn't my fault. I never reported it and after a year I decided the best thing would be to forget about it. I pretended it didn't happen and went on with my life. I forced it out of my thoughts until it was no longer a struggle to do so. Eventually I almost did forget about it. I never thought about it and when the subject was referenced in other contexts I never even thought about my particular experience. It almost became some movie I saw, or some girl I knew about. I'm married now with a four year old child and I have a really great life. About six months ago I started having these rape fantasies. I've been too embarrassed to ask my husband to act them out, but he does oblige in rough sex, and I started asking for it more often. I've felt confused as to why I would want this with my husband (and it is always with him ... I don't desire this with anyone else) when I have this history. It started me thinking about them even again. Then I started having nightmares about three weeks ago. Horrible realistic dreams where I actually wake up and I'm still hallucinating that men are holding me down. Last night I punched my husband full in the chest because I thought he was attacking me when he was just trying to wake me from a nightmare. This along with the COMPLETE lack of sexual desire where before we had a very healthy sex life. I'm a big fan of the "STOP THAT" approach to self help, but I can't seem to stop this. I'm beginning to dwell on it now.
Also I try not to ever deny husband and with the high job related stress he's having right now he's seeking sexual gratification every night. I'm beginning to dread bed time, and after he's asleep I'm up on the computer and drinking!
