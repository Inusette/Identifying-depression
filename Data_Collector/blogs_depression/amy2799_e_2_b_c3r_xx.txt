this is my first post.  I am 27, 5 and a half months pregnant dealing with depression / anxiety.  I have taken antidepressants off and on for a few years but stopped this summer because my husband and I were trying to conceive.  My pregnancy has been pretty rough this time around ... (I have an 8 year old son).  I've had joint problems, severe morning sickness ... and terrible depression / anxiety.  My husband just doesn't understand what I'm going through ... he thinks that I'm being hateful or sad on purpose.  He contributes to a lot of the way that I feel.  He told me early in the pregnancy, that if something was to happen and I lose the baby or it was born with something wrong with it, he would have a hard time not blaming me for it even if the doctor said that nothing could have prevented it.  This was said to me because I wasn't taking my prenatal vitamins at the time because of the morning sickness.  I could see if I were using drugs or drinking but I do not do those things.  I don't understand his thinking on that subject.

My mother in law is another person getting on my nerves.  She comes over uninvited and gives out unwanted advice.  She also has a way of making me angry with her thoughtless comments which are hurtful and unnecessary.  I can't talk to my husband about this because he would see me as the "bad guy".  Sometimes I just want to be alone ... away from people ... I feel like I don't have any privacy anymore.  My husband always makes me feel worse when I talk to him about how I feel.  I don't know why he aggravates me to talk to him then always says .... "Well, you ought to be thankful ... rrblah rrblah rrblah".  It isn't like I don't know that I could have it worse ... but he never cares what I feel at that moment.  I guess I better shut up ... I have ranted long enough ... although I feel like I could go on forever ... so sorry for the long post ...
