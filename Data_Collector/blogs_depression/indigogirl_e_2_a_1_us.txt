OK, for you guys out there- I apologize ahead of time... It's that time of the month for me - and I thought I was doing pretty well until this afternoon. It's like my hormones, brain chemicals and whatever else have done a complete 180 on me. Driving home today I prayed I would just make it safely because I was starting to feel so out of control.
I want to scream (which I can't because of where I live) or break things- or whatever else to get this anger out!!!  I don't even know where it's coming from!! All I know is everything is pissing me off!!!!!!!! Has anyone else ever felt like this? What do you do? I can't cry- the tears won't come. I'm thinking about watching a show I like, but I don't seem to like anything right now. Also, I'm supposed to be working from home right now, which is the last thing I want to do. I just want to take some Klonopin and make myself chill and go to sleep. I won't, though, because I'm still feeling responsible at this moment, despite my feelings of rage. I just want to get rid of these feelings!!! Any ideas??
