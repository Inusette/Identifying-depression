I'm trying to go back to school after dropping out of college many years back, and I've got this real supportive boyfriend who wants to help me. Problem is, he's got this need for me to go out there and change the world. He keeps saying I need to be better than everyone in my class, and that I need to be hyper - prepared before I even start class. I don't mind boning up on the class material beforehand, but he wants to help me come up with theses and bring those to my undergrad profs for help, and he wants me to read a whole bunch of texts from my chosen field before the semester starts. He also wants me to study anatomy because, as he says "anatomy doesn't really change", so I can be the "go to" person with whom all my classmates will want to study. I'm really bright and would like to make something out of myself, but he's got such high hopes and he wants me to do way too much way too soon. I don't even know for certain what I want to be at this point - getting back into the liberal arts program just seems like a good start towards deciding and acting. All this pressure from him is making it hard for me to even take the baby steps I need to take to make anything at all happen. When I try to tell him it's too much pressure, we wind up in a shouting argument (actually, I wind up doing most of the shouting - he just has this way of pressing my buttons.) I've spent my whole life as an inactive perfectionist, and all this from him just makes it hard to break free from that. Meanwhile, he's afraid that I'm going to spend my life playing video games (a reasonable fear at the moment.) He keeps saying lately that I need to move out of childhood, but he wants to parent me. rrbleh..

is there some way to just move around him without having all these arguments, and without letting him pressure me?
